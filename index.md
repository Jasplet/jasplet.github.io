# About

I am a postdoctoral researcher, who uses seismology to study dynamic Earth processes at a range of scales, both spatial and temporal. 

I am currently at the University of Oxford, where I am working as part of an [Oxford Martin School AGILE Initiative project](https://www.agile-initiative.ox.ac.uk/sprints/what-do-we-need-to-knre-co2-beneath-our-shelf-seas/) to develop methods to use micro-earthquakes to monitor offshore CO2 storage sites. I am also contributing to the EU ACT project [SHARP](https://www.sharp-storage-act.eu/work-package-2-seismicity/) where we are seeking to use signals from micro-earthquakes to obtain stress orientation and magnitude in near surface rocks passively (i.e., without having to stress them out further by drilling).

If you cannot find me in the office, you'll probably find me in one of Oxford's many Caf√©s, Cricket Grounds or in a swimming pool. Outside of work I am currently learning French, and am trying to manage my growing [Warhammer Collection](_posts/2023-09-23-warhammer_gallery.md).
