# About

I am a postdoctoral researcher, who uses seismology to study dynamic Earth processes at a range of scales, both spatial and temporal. 

I am currently at the University of Oxford. I have been working as part of an [Oxford Martin School AGILE Initiative project](https://www.agile-initiative.ox.ac.uk/sprints/what-do-we-need-to-knre-co2-beneath-our-shelf-seas/) to develop methods to use micro-earthquakes to monitor offshore CO2 storage sites. As part of this project I installed an eight element seismic array in North Yorkshire.

I also contributed to the EU ACT project [SHARP](https://www.sharp-storage-act.eu/work-package-2-seismicity/) where we are seeking to use signals from micro-earthquakes to obtain stress orientation and magnitude in near surface rocks passively (i.e., without having to stress them out further by drilling).

I am now collaborating with Dr Paula Koelemeijer on a project to detect microseimicity beneath London, and am continuing to work on onshore monitoring of offshore microseismicty and linking seismic anisotorpy to the subsurface stress field.

If you cannot find me in the office, you'll probably find me in one of Oxford's many Caf√©s, Cricket Grounds or in the gym. I currently play for [Oxford and Bletchingdon Nondescripts CC](https://obncc.play-cricket.com/home) and [Isis CC](http://www.isiscc.org.uk/).

Outside of work I am currently learning French, and am trying to manage my growing [Warhammer Collection](_posts/2023-09-23-warhammer_gallery.md).


<!-- By default, the theme only contains these few pages in order to stay lean and flexible. However, it can be easily extended to accommodate more pages, [collections](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/collections/), [categories, and tags](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/posts/#tags-and-categories). -->
